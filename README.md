# Competitive-Coding-Club
 The Competitive Coding Club is a group of students that recruits and trains students to represent MPSTME at various coding contests. We strive to provide opportunities for students to supplement their learnings with out-of-classroom experiences through regular meetings, discussions, competitions and workshops. Having a Discord server and WhatsApp group, we felt it was time to move one step ahead and build a website. We thought of this for two primary reasons: to be discoverable in search engine results and to build credibility. As far as the features of our website are concerned, we have implemented the following: Resources, Coding Calendar, Leader-board, Achievements and Profile Page.
